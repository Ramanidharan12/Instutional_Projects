# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

## Overview

This project is a simple yet effective solution for harvesting data from YouTube and storing it in a centralized warehouse for analysis, reporting, or further processing. The YouTube API is utilized for extracting relevant information from videos, channels, and playlists, and the data is then stored in a database for easy access and retrieval.

## Features

- **YouTube API Integration:** Leverage the power of the YouTube Data API to fetch data related to videos, channels, and playlists.

- **Data Harvesting:** Extract key information such as video titles, descriptions, view counts, likes, dislikes, comments, and more.

- **Data Warehousing:** Utilize a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and organize the harvested YouTube data efficiently.

- **Scheduled Data Updates:** Implement a scheduled task to regularly update the database with fresh data from YouTube, ensuring the information is always up-to-date.

- **Data Retrieval API:** Build an API that allows users to query and retrieve specific subsets of the YouTube data from the warehouse.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language for data harvesting and processing.

- **YouTube API:** Access YouTube data programmatically for harvesting relevant information.

- **Database:** Choose a relational database for warehousing YouTube data.

- **Flask (Optional):** Create a simple API for data retrieval.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up API Key:** Obtain a YouTube API key to authenticate requests to the YouTube Data API.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Configure Database:** Set up the database and update the configuration file with database connection details.

4. **Run Data Harvesting Script:** Execute the data harvesting script to fetch YouTube data and populate the database.

5. **(Optional) Build and Run API:** If using Flask for API, build and run the API server to allow users to retrieve data.
